                        I’m not your ordinary Filmmaker that picked up a camera as a kid,
                         because i didn’t really know how to use a camera until the age of 26.
                       The entire reason i got started with Photography & Videography was because I needed to take some photos
                        for my Fitness Apparel brand that i tried to start up. 
                        Since I couldn’t really afford a product photographer,
                         I decided to borrow a camera from a friend, and started learning the basics.
