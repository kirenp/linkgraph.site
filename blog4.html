                    <h3>Photographer</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Matt Komo is one of the highest caliber content creators in the digital space. His talents
                         as a filmmaker have taken him all over the world as he documents his unique perspective on his many destinations.
                        As GoPro’s former Head of Social Content, Matt was able to build out the brand’s visual aesthetic on social media by integrating 
                        his unique and instantly recognizable colors and style. During his nearly 3 years time there, Matt brought the brand’s 
                        presence on Instagram from 3 million to 13.6 million. His creative direction assisted with multiple product launches and 
                        global initiatives that helped to elevate the GoPro brand to be synonymous with some of the highest quality content in the world.
